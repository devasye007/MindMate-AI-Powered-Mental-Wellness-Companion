# MindMate – AI-Powered Mental Wellness Companion

MindMate is a **mental health and emotional wellness web application** built using **Flask**, **NLP**, and **Machine Learning**, designed to detect emotional states, assess mental health risk levels, and provide **personalized coping suggestions** — all **without heavy deep learning frameworks** like PyTorch or TensorFlow.

It’s lightweight, fast, and deployable even on low-resource systems, yet powerful enough to impress as a **major final-year project**.
